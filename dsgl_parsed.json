Division 4—Definitions 4.1\t\tDefinitions of terms between ‘single quotation marks’ are given in a Technical Note to the relevant item. 4.2\t\tDefinitions of terms between “double quotation marks” are as follows: “Accuracy” (2 3 6 7 8), usually measured in terms of inaccuracy, means the maximum deviation, positive or negative, of an indicated value from an accepted standard or true value. “Active flight control systems” (7) are systems that function to prevent undesirable “aircraft” and missile motions or structural loads by autonomously processing outputs from multiple sensors and then providing necessary preventive commands to effect automatic control. “Active pixel” (6) is a minimum (single) element of the solid state array which has a photoelectric transfer function when exposed to light (electromagnetic) radiation. “Additives” (ML8) means substances used in explosive formulations to improve their properties. “Adjusted Peak Performance” (4) is an adjusted peak rate at which “digital computers” perform 64-bit or larger floating point additions and multiplications, and is expressed in Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT) with units of 1012 adjusted floating point operations per second. “Aircraft” (1 6 7 9 ML8 ML10 ML14) means a fixed wing, swivel wing, rotary wing (helicopter), tilt rotor or tilt-wing airborne vehicle. “Airship” (9) means a power-driven airborne vehicle that is kept buoyant by a body of gas (usually helium, formerly hydrogen) which is lighter than air. “All compensations available” (2) means after all feasible measures available to the manufacturer to minimise all systematic positioning errors for the particular machine-tool model are considered. “Allocated by the ITU” (3 5) means the allocation of frequency bands according to the current edition of the ITU Radio Regulations for primary, permitted and secondary services. “Angle random walk” (7) means the angular error build up with time that is due to white noise in angular rate. (IEEE STD 528-2001) “Angular position deviation” (2) means the maximum difference between angular position and the actual, very accurately measured angular position after the workpiece mount of the table has been turned out of its initial position. “Asymmetric algorithm” (5) means a cryptographic algorithm using different, mathematically related keys for encryption and decryption. “Authentication” (5) means verifying the identity of a user, process or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system. This includes verifying the origin or content of a message or other information, and all aspects of access control where there is no encryption of files or text except as directly related to the protection of passwords, Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or similar data to prevent unauthorised access. “Automated Command and Control Systems” (ML11) means electronic systems, through which information essential to the effective operation of the grouping, major formation, tactical formation, unit, ship, subunit or weapons under command is entered, processed and transmitted. This is achieved by the use of computer and other specialised hardware designed to support the functions of a military command and control organisation. The main functions of an automated command and control system are: the efficient automated collection, accumulation, storage and processing of information; the display of the situation and the circumstances affecting the preparation and conduct of combat operations; operational and tactical calculations for the allocation of resources among force groupings or elements of the operational order of battle or battle deployment according to the mission or stage of the operation; the preparation of data for appreciation of the situation and decision-making at any point during operation or battle; computer simulation of operations. “Average output power” (6) means the total “laser” output energy in joules divided by the “laser duration” in seconds. “Basic gate propagation delay time” (3) means the propagation delay time value corresponding to the basic gate used in a “monolithic integrated circuit”. For a ‘family’ of “monolithic integrated circuits”, this may be specified either as the propagation delay time per typical gate within the given ‘family’ or as the typical propagation delay time per gate within the given ‘family’.",

Technical Note: For valves with different inlet and outlet diameters, the ‘nominal size’ in 2A226 refers to the smallest diameter. 2.\tB.\t\tTest, Inspection and Production Equipment Technical Notes: 1.\tFor the purposes of 2B, secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring mills or a secondary rotary axis the centre line of which is parallel to the primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes. Rotary axes need not rotate over 360°. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g., a screw or a rack-and-pinion). 2.\tFor the purposes of 2B, the number of axes which can be co-ordinated simultaneously for \"contouring control\" is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around which other relative motions within the machine are performed, such as: a.\tWheel-dressing systems in grinding machines; b.\tParallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces; c.\tCo-linear rotary axes designed for manipulating the same workpiece by holding it in a chuck from different ends. 3.\tFor the purposes of 2B, axis nomenclature shall be in accordance with International Standard ISO 841:2001, Industrial automation systems and integration - Numerical control of machines - Coordinate system and motion nomenclature. 4.\tFor the purposes of this Category, a \"tilting spindle\" is counted as a rotary axis. 5.\tFor the purposes of 2B, 'stated \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\"' may be used for each machine tool model as an alternative to individual machine tests, and is determined as follows: a.\tSelect five machines of a model to be evaluated; b.\tMeasure the linear axis repeatability (R↑,R↓) according to ISO 230-2:2014 and evaluate \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\" for each axis of each of the five machines; c.\tDetermine the arithmetic mean value of the \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\"-values for each axis of all five machines together. These arithmetic mean values of \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\"  become the stated value of each axis for the model d.\tSince the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many 'stated \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\"'-values as there are linear axes; e.\tIf any axis of a machine model not specified by 2B001.a. to 2B001.c. has a 'stated \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\"' equal to or less than the specified \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\" of each machine tool\nmodel plus 0.7 μm, the builder should be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once every eighteen months. 6.\tFor the purposes of 2B, measurement uncertainty for the \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\" of machine tools, as defined in the International Standard ISO 230-2:2014 or national equivalents, shall not be considered. 7.\tFor the purposes of 2B, the measurement of axes shall be made according to test procedures in 5.3.2. of ISO 230-2:2014. Tests for axes longer than 2 meters shall be made over 2 m segments. Axes longer than 4 m require multiple tests (e.g., two tests for axes longer than 4 m and up to 8 m, three tests for axes longer than 8 m and up to 12 m), each over 2 m segments and distributed in equal intervals over the axis length. Test segments are equally spaced along the full axis length, with any excess length equally divided at the beginning, in between, and at the end of the test segments.

TABLE — DEPOSITION TECHNIQUES: TECHNICAL NOTE Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows: a.\tChemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, “composite”, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or “laser” irradiation. N.B. 1:\tCVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes. N.B. 2:\tPack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture. N.B. 3:\tThe gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture. b.\tThermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporise the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesise compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating’s deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows: 1.\tElectron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating; 2.\tIon Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species; 3.\t“Laser” Vaporisation uses either pulsed or continuous wave “laser” beams to vaporise the material which forms the coating; 4.\tCathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionised plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition; N.B.:\tThis definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates. 5.\tIon Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionise the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process. c.\tPack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of: 1.\tThe metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof); 2.\tAn activator (normally a halide salt); and 3.\tAn inert powder, most frequently alumina. The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1,030 K (757°C) and 1,375 K (1,102°C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating. d.\tPlasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying. N.B. 1:\tLow pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure. N.B. 2:\tHigh velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20°C) at 0.1 MPa. e.\tSlurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating. f.\tSputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate. N.B. 1:\tThe Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials. N.B. 2:\tLow-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition. g.\tIon Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionised, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.",
